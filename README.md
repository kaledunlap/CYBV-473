This was my final project for CYBV-473 Violent Python course, taken in my Fall 2024 semester at the University of Arizona (Online). I earned an A in this course and achieved a perfect score of 100% on this project.
This course mainly focused on advanced practical applications of Python programming to support both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations. <br>
<br>
My three biggest takeaways from this course were the following: <br>
1. Learned more of the basic building blocks of the Python language. <br>
2. Gained experience with building things such as pen testing scripts, web scraping / web browsing tools, and scripts to crack passwords. <br>
3. Learned ways Python can be used to help the overall workflow of digital forensics investigations.
