This was my final project for CYBV-473 Violent Python course, taken in my Fall 2024 semester at the University of Arizona (Online). This course focused on advanced practical applications of Python programming to support offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations. <br>
<br>
My three biggest takeaways from this course were the following: <br>
1. Learned more of the basic building blocks of the Python language. <br>
2. Gained experience with building things such as pen testing scripts, web scraping / web browsing tools, scripts to crack passwords, and more. <br>
3. Learned ways Python can be used to help the overall workflow of digital forensics investigations.
